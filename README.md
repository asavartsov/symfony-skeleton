Symfony skeleton bundle
=======================

Symfony2 is a great framework and it already has symfony standard with all basic bundles included. This bundle
builds on that and adds more bundles, components and libraries to speed up your start with symfony.

Main goal here is to avoid doing things again for each time when you start new project.

How to start?
-------------

Composer is used as a packaging component for Symfony skeleton bundle. You can start by creating a new project:

``` sh
composer create-project mhlavac/symfony-skeleton your_new_web
```

Virtual LAMP server
-------------------

Set your working environment up in minutes by using virtual LAMP server. Everything is installed and configured so you don't
have to spend your time on setting your server, but you can spend your time on doing something fun for instance!

What's inside?
--------------

TODO write down all bundles, components and libraries which are used
